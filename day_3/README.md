## Problem Statement: 
> Create a Java application that calculates the factorial of a given number.

## Requirements:
- > The application should take a number as input from the user.
- > It should calculate the factorial of the input number.
- > The calculated factorial should be displayed as output.

## Approach 
> 1. Create a new Maven project using the Maven command provided in the concept section.
> 2. Open the `pom.xml` file and update the `<groupId>`, `<artifactId>`, and `<version>` tags according to your project's details.
> 3. Add any necessary dependencies to the `<dependencies>` section of the `pom.xml` file.
> 4. Create a new Java class, e.g., `FactorialCalculator`, in the `src/main/java/com/example` directory.
> 5. Implement the factorial calculation logic in the `FactorialCalculator` class.
> 6. Build the project using Maven:

   `mvn clean package`
 

This command will compile your code, package it into a JAR file, and place it in the `target` directory.
> 7. Run the application:


  ` java -cp target/myproject-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.FactorialCalculator`

Replace `myproject-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` with the actual name of the JAR file generated by Maven.
> 8. Follow the instructions in the application to enter a number and see the factorial result displayed. This will give you a basic understanding of using a `pom.xml` file in Maven to manage dependencies, compile your code, and package it into an executable JAR file.
