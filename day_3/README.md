## Problem Statement: 
> Create a Java application that calculates the factorial of a given number.

## Requirements:
> - The application should take a number as input from the user.
> - It should calculate the factorial of the input number.
> - The calculated factorial should be displayed as output.

## Approach 
> 1. Create a new Maven project using the Maven command:
>    - ```powershell
>      mvn archetype:generate "-DgroupId=com.example" "-DartifactId=my-app" "-DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart" "-DinteractiveMode=false"
>      ```
> 3. Open the `pom.xml` file and update the `<groupId>`, `<artifactId>`, and `<version>` tags according to your project's details.
> 4. Add any necessary dependencies to the `<dependencies>` section of the `pom.xml` file.
> 5. Create a new Java class, e.g., `FactorialCalculator`, in the `src/main/java/com/example` directory.
> 6. Implement the factorial calculation logic in the `FactorialCalculator` class.
> 7. Build the project using Maven:
>    - ```powershell
>      mvn clean package
>      ```
>    - This command will compile your code, package it into a JAR file, and place it in the `target` directory.
> 8. Run the application:
>    - ```powershell
>      java -cp target/myproject-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.FactorialCalculator
>      ```
>    - Replace `myproject-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` with the actual name of the JAR file generated by Maven.
> 9. Follow the instructions in the application to enter a number and see the factorial result displayed. This will give you a basic understanding of using a `pom.xml` file in Maven to manage dependencies, compile your code, and package it into an executable JAR file.
